QUESTION:
If a ball costs $1.05 and a bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, how much do they cost together?
Time: 31.586s
Memory: 75 MB

RESPONSE:
Based on the information provided in the given text, it is not specified how much the ball cost or how much the bat cost together. The text simply states that if a ball costs $1.05 and a bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, then they would cost together. It does not give any specific details about the price of each item separately or in combination.

QUESTION:
Calculate the derivative of f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7.
Time: 1m 35.261s
Memory: 76 MB

RESPONSE:
To calculate the derivative of the function f(x), we need to differentiate it with respect to x. The function f(x) is given by:

    f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7

We want to find the derivative of f(x) at x=1, which we can represent as:

    df/dx = 3((1 - 1)^4 - 2((1 - 1)^2 + 1 - 1)^2 + 5((1 - 1)^-2 - 0)^2 - 7(1 - 1)

First, we calculate the value of f(1):

    f(1) = 3 * 1^4 - 2 * 1^2 + 5 * (-1)^2 - 7 * 1

We can rearrange this expression as:

    df/dx = 3 * (1^4 - 2 * (-1)^2 + 5 * (-1)) / (1^2)

    df/dx = 6 * (-1)^2 / 1^2

    df/dx = 0.6 * (-1)^2 / 1^2

Substituting this expression into the original function f(x), we obtain:

    df/dx = 0.4 * (3 - 8) / 2^2

This is the derivative of the function f(x).

RESPONSE:
```python
def is_palindrome(str: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.
    
    :param str: The input string to check for palindrome.
    :return bool: True if the input string is a palindrome, False otherwise.
    """

    if len(str) < 2:
        return True
    
    start = end = 0
    while start < len(str) - 1 and end < len(str) - 1:
        if str[start] == str[end]:
            start += 1
            end += 1
        else:
            return False
    
    return True
```
