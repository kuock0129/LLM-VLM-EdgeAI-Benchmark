1. Who was the first person to walk on the moon and when did it happen?
Answer: Neil Armstrong, who walked on the moon with Buzz Aldrin and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin on July 20, 1969.

2. What year did it happen?
Answer: It happened on July 20, 1969.

3. How much does a ball cost and what is the additional cost for a bat?
Answer: The ball costs $1.05 (USD) and a bat costs $1.00 more than the ball ($1.05 + $0.10 = $1.15). Therefore, they are priced together at $1.15.

1. The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong, and it happened on July 20, 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission.

2. If a ball costs $1.05 and a bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, they cost together $1.05 + $1.00 = $2.05

3. The derivative of f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7 is calculated as follows:
   f'(x) = d/dx (3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7)
         = 12x^3 - 4x - 5

4. Here's a Python function to check if a string is a palindrome:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = s.lower()  # Ignore case
    reversed_s = s[::-1]  # Reverse the string
    if s == reversed_s:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function works by first converting the input string to lowercase, then reversing it and comparing it with the original. If they are equal, the input is a palindrome; otherwise, it isn't.
