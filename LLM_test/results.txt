Who was the first person to walk on the moon and when did it happen?

Reasoning: The first person to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong, who achieved this historic feat on August 21, 1969.

Mathematics

Calculate the derivative of f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7.

Coining: The derivative of a function is the change in the function as its parameters are changed. In this case, f(x) = 3x^4 - 2x^2 + 5x - 7, we can find that the derivative is given by:

d(f(x))/dx = (3)(-2)^2(x^4 - 2x^2 + 5) - (5)(x^2 - 7) = 0

Therefore, f'(x) = (3)(-2)^2(x^4 - 2x^2 + 5) / (x^2 - 7)

Coining: f' is the derivative of f. In this case, f' = (3)(-2)^2(x^4 - 2x^2 + 5) / (x^2 - 7)

The value of f'(x) is equal to the change in the function when its parameters are changed. In this case, f'(x) = (3)(-2)^2(x^4 - 2x^2 + 5) / (-2)(x^2 - 7)

Therefore, f' = (3)(-2)^2(x^4 - 2x^2 + 5) / (-2)(x^2 - 7)

Coining: This formula is called the "f'(x) = a(x^2 - b)" formula, where 'a' and 'b' are constants. The function f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 5 is given by the given values of a and b:

x^4 - 2x^2 + 5 = (x - 2)^2 + 4 * (-1)^n * x + n

Therefore, f'(x) = (3)(-2)^2(x^4 - 2x^2 + 5) / (-2)(x^2 - 7)

Finally, we can use this formula to calculate the derivative of any function:

f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 5
f'(x) = (3)(-2)^2(x^4 - 2x^2 + 5) / (-2)(x^2 - 7)

where we have used the value of f' at x = 2 and x = -1.
